## StochKit2R User Guide

Kevin R. Sanft
May 2018

This document provides usage instructions for StochKit2R.

## Introduction

StochKit2R is an R version of StochKit2.0, a software package for discrete
stochastic simulation using Gillespie’s Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA)
and tau-leaping [1-3]. It is designed to support much of the functionality of
StochKit2.0 (however, StochKit2R does not support non-reaction "events"--this
functionality may be added to future versions of StochKit2R).

StochKit2R was written by and is maintained by Kevin R. Sanft
(kevin@kevinsanft.com), with contributions by Harris Joseph and John Ravi at UNC
Asheville. The StochKit2.0 C++ code was written by Kevin R. Sanft, Sheng Wu,
Min Roh, Jin Fu, Rone Kwei Lim, and others from Professor Linda Petzold's
research group at UC Santa Barbara.

## Citing StochKit2R

If you use StochKit2R for simulations or analysis used in a publication or
presentation, please cite the software. A StochKit2R paper is in progress, but
until it is published, please cite the original StochKit2 paper:

```

## Acknowledgments

An early version of this work was partially supported by NSF grant DMS-1045015
(through St. Olaf College’s Center for Interdisciplinary Research). I also thank
Linda Petzold and her research group from the University of California,
Santa Barbara.

## Installation

<!--
As of this writing, StochKit2R is available on CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive
Network (http://cran.r-project.org/). Therefore, you should be able to install
it from the R console:

```r
install.packages("StochKit2R")
```
-->

StochKit2R is available on github. (It it currently NOT available on CRAN.)
See installation instructions below.

## Windows and Mac: Binary Installation (recommended)

Download the latest release from
https://github.com/StochKit2R/StochKit2R/releases. On Windows, download the .zip
file, on Mac download the .tgz file. (Note: you do not want to use the Source
Code links.) Then execute the following code to install:

```r
install.packages(file.choose(), repos=NULL)
```

The above code will open a file browser window. Navigate to the downloaded file
(typically this would be in your Downloads folder) and select it. After
successful installation, load and attach the package with:

```r
library(StochKit2R)
```

If the installation fails, you may need to update your R version. If
installation still fails, please install from source (see instructions below).

## Windows and Linux: Install from Source

You should be able to install the StochKit2R package from source using the R
console commands:

```r
install.packages("devtools") # Run once on your system
devtools::install_github("StochKit2R/StochKit2R")
```

(Note: on Windows, the above code will ask you to install additional tools. You
must install the tools. You will get a message saying installation failed
because it could not find the build tools. After installing the tools, rerun the
call to `devtools::install_github("StochKit2R/StochKit2R")` to install
StochKit2R.) 

You may see some compilation warning messages but there should be no errors.
After successful installation, load and attach the package with:

```r
library(StochKit2R)
```

## Mac: Install from Source (Serial Version)

As of this writing, the default compiler on recent versions of OS X does not
support OpenMP.
<!--
The gcc/g++ that comes with XCode's Command Line Tools is a wrapper
for clang/clang++, not **GNU** GCC.)
-->
StochKit2R uses OpenMP to run simulations in parallel. Without OpenMP,
StochKit2R uses only one processor. Therefore, installing from binary is
recommended for Mac users (see above). However, the following command will
install a serial version of StochKit2R.

```r
install.packages("devtools") #run once on your system
devtools::install_github("StochKit2R/StochKit2R", ref="serial")
```

Advanced Mac OS X users may want to view the additional instructions below on
installation from source for high performance.

<!--
## Installing from source (Mac OS X, Linux/Unix) and Windows binaries

Note: Installing from source will not install the dependencies. Therefore, you
must install the "ggplot2", "reshape", "Rcpp", "BH", and "XML" packages (via
install.packages) prior to installing StochKit2R.

**Mac OS X and Linux/Unix**

To install from source on Mac OS X, you must install XCode and the Command Line
Tools before proceeding. Advanced Mac OS X users may want to view the additional
instructions below on installation for high performance.

You can install from the source file StochKit2R\_\<version\>.tar.gz, available
at http://www.kevinsanft.com/StochKit2R, on Linux and Mac OS X by running the
following at a terminal (not the R console) from within the directory of the
.tar.gz file: R CMD INSTALL StochKit2R_\<version\>.tar.gz

Or, you can run the following command in the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("<path to>/StochKit2R_<version>.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
```

Where you replace \<path to\> with the path to the .tar.gz file and \<version\>
is the version number in the .tar.gz file name.
-->

**Advanced Mac OS X installation from source for high performance**

Advanced users can follow these instructions to install from source in a way
that enables parallel ensemble simulations on Mac OS X. (The Mac binary
installation described above will run in parallel, so these instructions are
only for those who want to install from source or for whom the binary cannot be
used.)

<!--
These instructions use **GNU** GCC. I tested it with GNU GCC 4.9. It may be
possible to do this with the experimental version of Clang here:
http://clang-omp.github.io/, but I have not tested it.

1.  Install **GNU** GCC. (XCode's gcc and g++ are symbolic links to clang and
clang++, respectively.) This can probably be done through homebrew, macports,
or from source.
2.	Download StochKit2R_\<version\>.tar.gz from http://www.kevinsanft.com/StochKit2R
3.	Unpack the StochKit2R .tar.gz file. In the file StochKit2R/src/Makevars,
replace the string "$(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)" with "–fopenmp" (two occurrences).
4.	Create or edit your ~/.R/Makevars file to contain the line:  
CXX=\<path to g++\>  
If an existing CXX line exists, replace it with the above line, where you should
 replace \<path to g++\> with the full path to the GNU g++. For example, on my
 system, it would be:  
 CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++ 
5.	In R, set the working directory to the unpacked StochKit2R directory with
the setwd function.
6.	In R, run devtools::load_all(recompile=T, export_all=F).

You will need to install the devtools package first, if you haven’t already.
-->

1. Download the Mac clang binary with OpenMP support (as of this writing, the
   current file is
   http://r.research.att.com/libs/clang-4.0.0-darwin15.6-Release.tar.gz)
   from http://r.research.att.com/libs/.
2. Unpack the .tar.gz file. Copy the clang4 directory to your /usr/local/
   directory.
3. Create (or edit your existing) ~/.R/Makevars file to include the following
   lines:  
   `CC=/usr/local/clang4/bin/clang`  
   `CXX=/usr/local/clang4/bin/clang++`  
   `LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/clang4/lib`  
   (Where /usr/local/ is replaced with your path to the clang4 directory, if
   different.)
4. In R, run: `devtools::install_github("StochKit2R/StochKit2R")`

If everything worked correctly, you may see some compilation warning messages
but you should see no errors. You should also be able to scroll up to view the
compilation commands to confirm that the clang4 compiler and –fopenmp were used
in the compile commands.

<!--
**Windows**

Windows binary packages are available. On Windows, download
StochKit2R_\<version\>.zip from http://www.kevinsanft.com/StochKit2R.

To install the package from .zip file:

* In RStudio: under the Tools menu, choose "Package Archive File (.zip, .tar.gz)"
from the "Install from:" dropdown menu. Then locate the .zip file, then click Install.
* In Rgui: under the Packages menu, choose "Install package(s) from local zip files".
Then locate the .zip file.

## Running a simulation

StochKit2R contains three primary stochastic simulation functions: ssa,
ssaSingle, and tauLeaping.

ssa and tauLeaping run ensembles (multiple simulation trajectories) and output
data at regularly spaced time intervals. They have nearly identical function
calls. Consult the help pages for information. Here are the key arguments:

* modelFile: the path to the StochKit2 xml model file.
* time: the simulation time. Each simulation will run from 0 to time.
* realizations: number of simulations that will be run.
* intervals: number of intervals between output. The default, 0, specifies that
  output will be stored only for the simulation end time. 1 indicates output will
  be stored at time 0 and the end time. 2 indicates output at time 0, the middle
  of the simulation time and the end time, etc. Note data is stored at
  (intervals + 1) time points.
* noStats: when set to TRUE, statistics (means and variances) data will not be
  stored. Default is FALSE. If set to TRUE, keepTrajectories or keepHistograms
  must be set to TRUE.
* keepTrajectories: when TRUE, trajectory data will be stored. Default is FALSE.
* keepHistograms: when TRUE, historgram data will be stored. Default is FALSE.

See the help pages (for example, ?ssa) for additional arguments and details.

An example of running the ssa function:

```r
# use the dimer_decay.xml model that is included with StochKit2R
# to make things easier to read, store the path in a variable
model = system.file("dimer_decay.xml", package="StochKit2R")
# now, run a simulation:
out = ssa(modelFile=model, time=10, realizations=100, intervals=20)
```

The above function will run 100 simulations to time 10 using 20 output intervals
(21 output times, including the initial time=0 population). The returned list of
data frames will be stored in the variable named out. The above example uses the
dimer_decay.xml file included with the StochKit2R distribution.

In the more typical case, the model file will be stored elsewhere in your file
system. For example:

```r
out = ssa("~/Desktop/dimer_decay.xml", 10, 100, 20)
```

The file dimer_decay.xml must exist in the ~/Desktop directory. You can copy it
there using: `file.copy(model, "~/Desktop/dimer_decay.xml")`, where model is
defined as above. (This corresponds to a machine-specific full path such as
"/Users/kevinsanft/Desktop/dimer_decay.xml", which might be required on some
systems. On Windows, "~" usually corresponds to the user's Documents folder,
so ~/Desktop would not be a valid path.)

ssaSingle runs a single trajectory and outputs a row of data for every reaction
event that occurs to a file. The function takes as arguments: a path to a
StochKit2 .xml model and a simulation end time. Here is the example from the
documentation, using the dimer_decay.xml model that is included with the
StochKit2R package:

```r
out = ssaSingle(system.file("dimer_decay.xml", package="StochKit2R"), 10)
```

The above command will run one realization from time 0 to 10. Note: the returned
data frame will contain about 25,000 rows, one row for each reaction event (plus
one for the initial population and one line for the end time).

ode runs a simulation of a model using the corresponding population form of the
reaction rate equations using a standard differential equation solver. Note:
A+A homodimer rates are converted from c*A*(A-1)/2 propensities to c*A*A rates.
Custom propensities are not converted. To run an ODE to time 10 using 20 output
intervals:

```r
out = ode(system.file("dimer_decay.xml", package="StochKit2R"), time=10, intervals=20)
```

## Plotting

StochKit2R includes four plotting functions for visualizing simulation ensemble
output data from ssa and tauLeaping (these are not designed to work with
ssaSingle or ode data).

* plotStats
* plotTrajectories
* plotHistograms
* histogramDistance

Consult the R function documentation (e.g. ?plotStats) for details. Here an
example of the plotStats function, which plots the means and +/- one standard
deviation curves.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.align="center"}
library(StochKit2R)
# example using included dimer_decay.xml file
model = system.file("dimer_decay.xml", package="StochKit2R")
# output value stored locally for use and written to ex_out file in working directory
out = ssa(modelFile=model, time=10, realizations=100, interval=20)
# plot the data for species 2 and 3 (indexes; could also use names)
plotStats(out, c(2, 3))
```

This example has small relative variances, so the +/- standard deviation curves
are very close to the mean curves. Examples for the other plot commands can be
found on their help pages (for example, ?plotTrajectories).

## Model definition file format

StochKit2R simulations use models in the StochKit2 xml model definition format.
The StochKit2 model definition format uses tags to specify the description of a
biochemical model in an xml format.

A sample model file, dimer_decay.xml, is included with the StochKit2R package.
You can access it with the R command:
`system.file("dimer_decay.xml", package="StochKit2R")`

To copy this file to a location of your choice, you can use R’s file.copy
function. For simplicity, first copy the dimer_decay.xml path into a variable,
then call file.copy:

```r
model = system.file("dimer_decay.xml", package="StochKit2R")
file.copy(model, "~/Desktop/dimer_decay.xml")
```

Again, "~/Desktop/dimer_decay.xml" must be a valid path; replace the destination
with the appropriate path on your system. (On Windows, the dimer_decay.xml file
may be difficult to read and edit due in some viewers and editors due to the way
Windows handles newlines in text files.)

After you have copied dimer_decay.xml, you can view it in a text editor. Here,
I will view it in R:

```r
model = system.file("dimer_decay.xml", package="StochKit2R")
writeLines(readLines(model))
```

The file structure is simple:

The first tag, "\<Model\>" indicates the beginning of the model definition. The
closing tag \</Model\> at the end indicates the end of the model definition.
Most xml tags must be matched by a closing tag. The \<NumberOfReactions\> and
\<NumberOfSpecies\> tags are required and specify the number of reactions and
species, respectively, in the model. The "ReactionsList" tag encloses one or
more (in this case only one) "\<Reaction\>" elements. A Reaction must contain
an "\<Id\>" and a "\<Type\>". In most cases, a Reaction contains a
"\<Reactants\>" tag and a "\<Products\>" tag to specify the reactant and product
species, respectively. In StochKit2R, the Reaction Type must be "mass-action",
and the "\<Rate\>" tag is required. The Rate is the stochastic reaction rate
that is multiplied by the Reactants’ populations to calculate the propensity [1].

The above model definition file describes a model with 3 species and 4 reactions.
Reaction R1 has one SpeciesReference tag within the Reactants and no Products.
(Note the SpeciesReference does not use a closing tag, but instead ends the
opening tag with "/\>") Since the stoichiometry of the Reactant is 1 and there
are no products, Reaction R1 describes species S1 decaying into "nothing".

NOTE: The rate constants in StochKit2 models are interpreted as stochastic rate
constants (see Gillespie 1977). For enzymatic reactions where a species is both
a reactant and a product, the species should appear in the Reactants and
Products to ensure the mass‐action propensity is computed correctly.

The best way to create your own model is to copy and rename an existing model
file, then open it in a text editor and modify it to suit your needs. Save it
with a .xml extension.

The StochKit2 model definition supports (global) parameters as seen in the model
above. Instead of putting a numeric value as the Rate, a parameter is used.
Parameters are defined within the ParametersList tag.

NOTE: parameters cannot be functions of the species' populations.

## Customized propensity functions

In the dimer_decay.xml example model, the Type tag within Reaction R1 had the
value "mass‐action". When Type is "mass‐action", the propensity function is
determined by the Rate and the population(s) of the reactant species
[Gillespie 1977]. These "mass-action" reactions are limited to elementary
reactions with 0, 1, or 2 Reactants (NOTE: 3rd order reactions are also accepted
as valid mass‐action reactions but are discouraged since they require the
simultaneous collision of 3 molecules.).

StochKit2R allows for non‐elementary reactions by specifying a Reaction Type of
"customized". When the Reaction Type is "customized", the <PropensityFunction>
tag is required. The example below specifies that species "S1" and "S2" react
with stochastic rate constant 2.0.

```xml
<Type>customized</Type>
<PropensityFunction>2.0*S1*S2</PropensityFunction>
```

WARNING: the expression must be a valid __C++__ expression, not an R expression!

NOTE: In order for the above PropensityFunction to be valid, species S1 and S2
must be defined and *should* be listed as Reactants in the Reaction. The
expression in the PropensityFunction must be a valid expression composed of
arithmetic operators (`+`,`‐`,`*`,`/`), species Id values, Parameters, and some
C++ functions (e.g. `pow`, `exp`). Careless use of customized propensity
functions can lead to errors and can cause StochKit2 to crash. "mass‐action"
is the preferred Reaction Type.

There is an example model file named schlogl.xml that includes both mass-action
and customized propensity functions that you can access in the same way the
dimer_decay.xml file was accessed above. (The schlogl model is a toy model with
one species that displays bimodality--try running an ensemble to time=10 and
keep trajectories or histogram data.) Note that the customized propensity
functions could evaluate to negative values (for example if S1=0)--this will
cause unexpected behavior (and likely crash StochKit2R). Negative propensities
are unlikely for the Schlogl model (because the population tends to stay large)
but this issue can cause serious problems in other models. It is possible to
prevent negative values, see the FAQ section below. Again, "mass‐action" is the
preferred Reaction Type--use customized propensities at your own risk.

## Writing/reading stochastic ensemble data to/from files

You can save your ensemble stochastic simulation data (from ssa or tauLeaping)
to a directory using writeEnsembleData. Data written to file can be read back
in to R using readEnsembleData.

## Bugs/FAQ

1. How do I create a model file?

* The best way is to start with an existing model file and modify it as
  necessary. You can create a copy of the dimer_decay.xml file using the
  following commands:

  ```r
  model = system.file("dimer_decay.xml", package="StochKit2R")
  file.copy(model, "~/some_file.xml")
  ```

  The above command will copy the file dimer_decay.xml with the name
  some_file.xml (choose a more meaningful name) into your home directory (on Mac
  or Linux) or your Documents folder (on Windows). You can then edit it using a
  text editor (for example, the RStudio editor).

2. I get an error message stating "Error in buildStochKit2Rmodel(modelFile) :
   Events not supported in StochKit2R".

* Sorry, StochKit2R currently does not support Events, so please do not report
  this as a bug.

3. If you receive an error message reading "Error in fetch(key) : lazy-load
   database ... is corrupt", this is a known R bug
   (https://github.com/hadley/devtools/issues/419). If you restart R and reload
   StochKit2R, the messages should go away.

4. How do I prevent negative values in a customized propensity function?

* You can use the C++ `max` function to set the propensity to the larger of the
  propensity or 0. For example, to prevent reaction A2 from going negative in
  the schlogl.xml model, you could write:

  ```xml
  <PropensityFunction>std::max(R2/6.0*S1*(S1-1)*(S1-2),(double)0.0)</PropensityFunction>
  ```

  Note the function is "`std::max`" and that the value 0 is forced to be a
  double to ensure the compiler knows the types.

5. Installation appears to hang when installing from source on Windows.

* Very slow or failed installation has been observed when trying to install
  the BH package, which is required by StochKit2R. BH is a large package (over
  100 MB). Slow or failed installation seems more likely to occur on machines
  with a networked file system and/or systems where the user does not have admin
  access. You can attempt to install the BH package separately. Perhaps store
  your R package library on a local hard disk as described here:
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31272280/installation-of-r-package-bh-not-possible. 

6. My simulation crashes without any helpful messages.

* StochKit2R might not "fail gracefully" if an error occurs while running in
  parallel. The most likely cause of a crash is a problem in a customized
  propensity function; for example, a function that can evaluate to a negative
  value or that can have a positive value when a Reactant is 0 (causing a
  negative population). Carefully check your custom propensities for these
  conditions.

* You can also try restarting R and reloading StochKit2R.

* If the bug persists please report it following the instructions below.
